# wix-verify

This program allows us to check that the WXS file entries match the files in application output.

With

```
wix-verify check-output "\path\to\project" "wxs-file-1" "wxs-file-2"
```

You can automate checking for dependencies in your WXS files and make sure that all dependencies are added to WXS files like they should be.
